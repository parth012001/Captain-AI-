# Chief AI Email Assistant - System Architecture

## Overview

The Chief AI Email Assistant has been completely refactored from a monolithic 4000+ line single file into a scalable, maintainable microservice-style architecture with clean separation of concerns.

## Architecture Evolution

### Before: Monolithic Structure (v1)
```
src/
├── index.ts (4000+ lines)
    ├── All routes mixed together
    ├── Business logic embedded in routes
    ├── No service organization
    └── Difficult to maintain/scale
```

### After: Organized Microservice Architecture (v2)
```
src/
├── index.ts (400 lines) - Clean entry point
├── core/                 - Infrastructure layer
├── routes/               - API endpoint organization
├── services/             - Business logic layer
├── models/               - Data access layer
├── middleware/           - Cross-cutting concerns
└── types/                - TypeScript definitions
```

## Core Infrastructure Layer

### Service Container (`/src/core/serviceContainer.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Dependency injection and service management
- **Pattern**: Singleton container with type-safe service registry
- **Benefits**: Loose coupling, easy testing, centralized service management

```typescript
// Type-safe service access across the application
const emailService = serviceContainer.get('emailModel');
const aiService = serviceContainer.get('aiService');
```

### Service Bootstrap (`/src/core/serviceBootstrap.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Initialize and register all application services
- **Pattern**: Builder pattern for service initialization
- **Lifecycle**: Database connection → Service creation → Container registration → Background services

### Webhook Processor (`/src/core/webhookProcessor.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized webhook business logic
- **Pattern**: Event-driven processing with concurrency limits
- **Features**: Multi-user support, atomic operations, error handling

## API Layer Architecture

### Route Organization
All API endpoints are logically grouped into specialized route files:

| Route File | Purpose | Endpoints | Example |
|------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| `emails.ts` | Email management & promotional emails | 6 routes | `/api/v2/emails/fetch` |
| `drafts.ts` | Draft viewing and management | 2 routes | `/api/v2/drafts/:id` |
| `calendar.ts` | Calendar integration & scheduling | 9 routes | `/api/v2/calendar/events` |
| `meetings.ts` | Meeting detection, confirmations & auto-scheduling | 19 routes | `/api/v2/meetings/detect` |
| `ai.ts` | AI analysis, context intelligence & responses | 23 routes | `/api/v2/ai/analyze-tone-real` |
| `learning.ts` | Learning system & analytics | 5 routes | `/api/v2/learning/insights` |
| `auto-drafts.ts` | Auto-generated draft pipeline | 6 routes | `/api/v2/auto-drafts/:id/send` |
| `webhooks.ts` | Gmail webhook infrastructure | 10 routes | `/api/v2/webhooks/gmail` |
| `admin.ts` | Database schema & admin operations | 6 routes | `/api/v2/admin/schema/reset` |
| `debug.ts` | Debug tools & system inspection | 4 routes | `/api/v2/debug/email/:id` |
| `misc.ts` | Health checks & testing utilities | 4 routes | `/api/v2/misc/health/email-parsing` |

### API Versioning Strategy
- **Current**: `/api/v2/*` for all new organized endpoints
- **Legacy**: `/auth/*` and `/health` preserved for backward compatibility
- **Future**: `/api/v3/*` can be added without breaking existing clients

### Request/Response Flow
```
Client Request → Express Router → Route Handler → Service Layer → Model Layer → Database
     ↓              ↓                ↓               ↓             ↓            ↓
   Auth Check → Validation → Business Logic → Data Processing → SQL Query → Response
```

## Service Layer Architecture

### Service Registry Pattern
Complete TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety and IntelliSense:

```typescript
interface ServiceRegistry {
  gmailService: GmailServiceInterface;
  emailModel: EmailModelInterface;
  aiService: AIServiceInterface;
  contextService: ContextServiceInterface;
  // ... 20+ more services
}
```

### Key Services

#### Gmail Service (`GmailService`)
- OAuth2 token management with encryption
- Email fetching and parsing
- Webhook subscription management
- Multi-user support with user isolation

#### AI Services (`AIService`, `ContextService`, `ResponseService`)
- OpenAI integration with fallback models
- Email tone analysis and categorization
- Context intelligence and entity extraction
- Smart response generation with learning

#### Meeting Services (`MeetingDetectionService`, `AutoSchedulingService`)
- Intelligent meeting request detection
- Calendar integration and availability checking
- Automated scheduling with time suggestions
- Meeting confirmation workflow

#### Learning Service (`LearningService`)
- User edit analysis for continuous improvement
- Success metrics calculation and trending
- Pattern recognition for better responses
- Weekly performance analysis

## Data Layer Architecture

### Database Schema Evolution
- **Phase 1-4**: Complete 24/7 AI Assistant schema
- **Atomic Operations**: Transaction-based data integrity
- **User Isolation**: Multi-tenant data separation
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized for real-time queries

### Models Layer
Each service has a corresponding model for data access:
- `EmailModel` - Email storage and retrieval
- `DraftModel` - Draft management and versioning
- `ContextModel` - Context intelligence data
- `CalendarModel` - Calendar event management
- `AutoGeneratedDraftModel` - AI-generated content

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth2 Flow**: Google OAuth for Gmail access
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure session management
- **Token Encryption**: Sensitive data protection
- **User Context**: Request-level user identification

```typescript
// Advanced rate limiting with memory cleanup
const rateLimiter = new Map<string, {count: number, resetTime: number}>();
```

### Input Validation
